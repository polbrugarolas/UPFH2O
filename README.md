# Real-Time Database Integration and Predictive Maintenance System
# Integrated Leak Detection and Reparation System CodeLeakDetection.ipynb

## Overview

This project simulates an advanced system for integrating real-time sensor data, detecting anomalies in water pipelines, and performing predictive maintenance. The system is designed to:

- Integrate real-time data streams for sound, vibration, and temperature sensors.
- Detect pipeline leaks using anomaly thresholds.
- Adjust water distribution dynamically in response to detected leaks.
- Use predictive analytics to forecast maintenance needs and optimize repair schedules.

**Important**: The current implementation uses a simulated dataset. For real-world deployment, you must replace this with a real-time data source.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Simulated database structure to mimic real-time data handling.
- **Leak Detection**: Identifies anomalies in sensor readings and flags leaks.
- **Dynamic Water Distribution**: Adjusts water flow based on detected leaks.
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Forecasts maintenance requirements using a regression model trained on historical data.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## File Structure

- `realtime_database_integration.py`: Main script to simulate real-time database integration and system functionality.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (this document).

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Simulating Real-Time Data

1. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python realtime_database_integration.py
   ```
2. The script generates synthetic sensor data and processes it in a simulated real-time database environment.
3. Outputs include:
   - Leak detection summary for each update cycle.
   - Visualizations for predictive maintenance.

### 2. Transition to Real-Time Data

To replace the simulated data with real-time inputs:

1. **Set up a live data source**:

   - Use APIs, IoT devices, or other data streams to provide real-time sensor readings.
   - Ensure data format matches the schema used in the script (`sound`, `vibration`, `temperature`).

2. **Modify the ************************`RealTimeDatabase`************************ class**:
   Replace the `update` method to fetch data from your live source instead of generating simulated data:

   ```python
   def update(self, new_data):
       """Fetch and append live data."""
       live_data = fetch_live_data_source()  # Replace with your data fetching logic
       self.data = pd.concat([self.data, live_data], ignore_index=True)
   ```

3. **Test the integration**:

   - Run the updated script.
   - Verify that live data is processed correctly for leak detection and water distribution adjustments.

### 3. Customization

- Update thresholds for leak detection:
  ```python
  SOUND_THRESHOLD = 70
  VIBRATION_THRESHOLD = 40
  TEMPERATURE_THRESHOLD = 25
  ```
- Adjust regression model parameters for predictive maintenance:
  ```python
  model = LinearRegression()
  model.fit(X, y)
  ```

### 4. Visualizations

The script generates:

- **Leak Detection Logs**: Highlights anomalies and water flow adjustments.
- **Predictive Maintenance Chart**: Visualizes forecasted maintenance needs.
